               <h2>Why Learning HTML is the First Step to Becoming a Web Developer</h2>
            <h3>By Ayomikun  .  August 16, 2025.</h3>
            <h2>WHAT IS HTML?</h2>
            <p>HTML(HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone of every website you see on the internet. It provides the structure that allows browsers to display text, images, videos, and links. Without HTML, the web would not exist as we know it today.</p>
            <h2>WHY HTML IS BEGINNER FRIENDLY?</h2>
            <p>One of the best things about HTML is that it's beginner-friendly. Unlike many programming languages, HTML is not about logic or calculations, it's about describing content. For example, you use "h1 tags" for title, 'P tags" for paragraph, and "img tags" for images.</p>
            <h2>HTML AS THE FOUNDATION OF WEB DEVELOPMENT?</h2>
            <p>Learning HTML opens the door to other important web technologies like CSS and JavaScript. Once you understand how a webpage is structured, styling and interactivity become much easier to learn.</p>
            <h2>MY LEARNING EXPERIENCE AS A WEB DEVELOPER?</h2>
            <p>Before I embarked on this journey as a web developer, I came in with the mindset of a designer because I once learnt graphics design. I didn't realize that web development would require me to write code instead of just designing. This shift taught me to think more deeply and to practice patience.</p>

            <p>I got inspired by my own curiosity. I always wondered: How do people actually build websites, create links, and develop applications? And how do they earn from it? That curiosity pushed me to take my first steps.</p>

            <p>But the journey hasn't been smooth. At first, i struggled badly with file paths, nesting, and indentation. Honestly, it almost drove me crazyâ€”I even shut down my laptop at some point ðŸ˜‚ and told myself, "Ordinary HTML is already making me crash out because i heard many people complain of javaScript that it's hell". Yet, every challenge built my resilience.My first small wins-like figuring out file paths, getting nesting right, and recently building my portfolio and uploading it to Github-gave me a sense of accomplishment.</p>

            <p>Now I'm looking forward to learning CSS so i can add real styling and bring life to my projects. I'm also curious about JavaScript, the magic that makes websites interactive. I can't wait to explore those and keep growing on this journey.</p>

            <p>If you want to start your journey as a web developer, mastering HTML is a must. It's the foundation of your skills, and every other language you learn will build on it</p>
